## Architecture Components

### Client Apps
- **Web Application**: React.js frontend built with Vite
- **Mobile Application**: Potential React Native implementation

### API Gateway
- **Express Router**: Central entry point for all client requests
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT validation and user session management

### Microservices
1. **User Authentication Service**
   - Handles user registration, login, and session management
   - Integrates with OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn)
   - Manages user profiles and permissions

2. **Developers API**
   - Manages developer profiles, skills, and availability
   - Handles developer search and filtering
   - Processes developer ratings and reviews

3. **Students API**
   - Manages student profiles and project requirements
   - Tracks student interactions and project history
   - Handles student support and feedback

4. **Discussions API**
   - Manages forum threads and posts
   - Handles real-time comments and notifications
   - Moderates content and user interactions

5. **Payments API**
   - Processes payments via Stripe integration
   - Manages subscription billing and invoicing
   - Handles payment disputes and refunds

6. **Notifications API**
   - Manages in-app notifications
   - Sends email notifications via Nodemailer
   - Processes real-time alerts and updates

### Databases
- **MongoDB**: Primary database for all services
- **Mongoose**: ODM for data modeling and validation

### External Services
- **Pusher**: Real-time messaging and notifications
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and subscription management
- **ZegoCloud**: Video communication and streaming
- **Nodemailer**: Email delivery service

## Communication Patterns
- RESTful API communication between services
- WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Message queuing for asynchronous processing

## Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Password encryption with Bcrypt
- CORS configuration for API protection
- Input validation and sanitization
